# Inbox Eagle

An app that queries your unread emails and ranks them in importance based on which ones need a reply from you.

Configurable to use either a local LLM or an OpenAI API model.

Check out [this article](https://nathanclonts.com/prioritizing-your-email-inbox-with-ai/) for a walkthrough of the application in more depth.

## Getting started

1. `cp .env.example .env`
2. `cp prompt-config.example.json prompt-config-setup.json`
3. Set up Gmail API credentials
    - You can create access credentials via the [Gmail Cloud console API page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/gmail.googleapis.com)
    - Enable the following scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify`
    - Set the application type to "Web Application"
    - Add an Authorized Redirect URI of: `http://localhost:33339/`
    - Download the Gmail credentials JSON file
4. Place the Gmail credentials JSON in this directory named `credentials-gmail.json`.
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. `cd client && npm install`

## Running the script

Run the command line script, which authorizes Gmail and runs the evaluation process:

```
$ python run_script.py
```

This will save your Gmail credentials to a token.pickle file locally.

Run the server:

```sh
$ python start.py
```

Run the front-end client:

```sh
$ cd client
$ npm start
```

- Web frontend
    - User clicks Evaluate emails to contact the Python server
- Python server
    - ‚úâÔ∏è Fetch emails via the Gmail API
    - üîÅ For each email:
        - ‚úçÔ∏è Compose a prompt to the LLM based on the user's personalized configuration
        - üß† Query the LLM (twice)
            - First, we ask for a written evaluation of the email's importance, including a score on a scale of 1 to 10
            - Second, we ask the LLM to extract the numeric score from the written evaluation
- Web frontend
    - Display the results of the evaluation!
